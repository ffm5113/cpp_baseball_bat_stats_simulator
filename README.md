# cpp_baseball_stat_simulator
The Baseball Batting Stat Simulator Program (C++) uses the rand function to create a statistical model, which is used to simulate 1000 at-bats based on a player's careers averages. After the simulation values are calculated and displayed, a loop asks the user if they would like to run another simulation.
